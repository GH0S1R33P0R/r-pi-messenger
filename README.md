r-pi-messenger
==============

A system to send messages to a Raspberry pi with an Adafruit LCD board.
The files are:
index.php -- web page to run the python scripts
server.py -- python script to parse a file called "Messages.txt" which is written to by index.php
blinkServer.py -- causes the LCD board to blink in order to notify of new messages.

The remaining files belong to Adafruit and I am simply using them to drive the LCD display.
